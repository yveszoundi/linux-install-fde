* About this repository

I'm more interested in [[https://distrowatch.com/search.php?ostype=Linux&category=All&origin=All&basedon=Independent&notbasedon=None&desktop=All&architecture=All&package=All&rolling=All&isosize=All&netinstall=All&language=All&defaultinit=All&status=Active#simple][independent Linux distributions]] than their variants (i.e Debian instead of Ubuntu)
- I can apply most (if not all) concepts from the parent distribution to all its derivatives
- I prefer to heavily customize my systems from scratch

I might include notes about BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD) and Solaris in the future.

* General notes  

The "easiest way" to setup systems with full disk encryption is to perform manual installations (IMHO).
- This gives you *full flexibility* over how things are configured
- *This assumes that you're very comfortable* (or resourceful) with the command-line within a chroot environment
- This is not as difficult as you think
